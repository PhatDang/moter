## bring your workstation to life!
!['demo-gif'](./moter-480.gif)

### What is this? 
Moter is a motion picture terminal designed to enhance your workstation experience. For those that may spend many hours each day working in the terminal, staring at a black screen can be an isolating experience. I created motor for myself because I am one of those people and time lapse footage of outer space makes me happy. 

### Quickstart:
`brew cask install moter`  
`motor start <video-path>`  
`motor stop`

### How should I use this?  
#### Terminals
Recommended: iTerm  

Motor works best on iTerm. If you are using Motor with the Apple Terminal, the only difference is you will need to manually adjust your terminal opacity settings. 

#### Formats
Motor uses VLC media player behind the scenes, so any [supported format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLC_media_player#Input_formats) will work here too. You can even use a URL (youtube,etc). I also included a couple samples to get you started. 

#### Permissions
The following applications need to be enabled accessibility access:
- Spectacle
- VLC
- Terminal/iTerm
